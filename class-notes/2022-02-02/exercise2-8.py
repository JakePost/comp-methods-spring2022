# Exercise 2.8

# Suppose arrays a and b are defined as
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], int)
b = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8], int)

# What will the computer print for the following commands

print(b / a + 1)
print(b / (a + 1))
print(b // (a + 1))

# What happens if you do this with lists instead

# a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# b = [2, 4, 6, 8]
#
# print(b / a + 1)
# print(b / (a + 1))
# print(b // (a + 1))

# Unable to run div operations on list
