    "## Package Management\n",
    "\n",
    "* The thousands of packages available in Python is one of the language's greatest strength.\n",
    "* However, it can be very hard to keep track of them. People constantly update them so they need to be updated locally.\n",
    "* A package management system is code that helps you with this, ```conda``` and ```pip``` are both package management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda is a way to add and manage the packages in your python distro. Some useful commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```% conda list [name]```\n",
    "* lists the package name if installed \\[or all packages installed\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "```% conda search name```\n",
    "* searches for packages with this name\n",
    "\n",
    "```% conda install name```\n",
    "* installs the package by name\n",
    "\n",
    "```% conda update name```\n",
    "* updates the package by name\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "* The anaconda team maintains the default channel for you conda installation. However, you may find that you want some package that is not included in the default installation.\n",
    "* There are other channels that you can use to find packages, the most common alternative to default is conda-forge. This channel tries to get updates out faster and new packages into the channel quicker.\n",
    "* To search or install a package from a different channel use ```-c conda forge``` after the command.\n",
    "* If you only install a few packages from a different channel you will probably be all right, but the more you do the more likely this will cause problems, if you really want to use conda-forge you set it as your default channel, If you do that also set your ```channel_priority``` to strict.\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda cnofig --add channels conda-forge```\n",
    "```conda config --set channel_priority strict```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### PIP\n",
    "\n",
    "* AN alternative package manager is pip. Pip is only for python and has a somewhat larger selection of packages. However, pip doesn't know about conda while conda knows about pip. So I tend to try conda first and then us epip if conda doesn't work.\n",
    "* Pip has similar commands but slightly different\n",
    "\n",
    "```pip freeze```\n",
    "```pip serach name```\n",
    "```pip install name ```\n",

    "## Accuracy and Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are two main considerations for most computer algorithm which are often in tension with each other; accuracy and speed.\n",
    "* __Accuracy__ refers to how close the computed number is to what one would get analytically when possible or compared to a more accurate calculation if possible.\n",
    "* __Speed__ refers to the time (or CPU time) it takes to perform the calculations.\n",
    "* Usually accuracy and speed are in conflict in that you could perform a more accurate calculation, but it would take loner, and you can get a faster calculation in less time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Precision\n",
    "\n",
    "* Floats are stored on a computer using a fixed number of bits. Bits are either 0 or 1. If we write a number in scientific nation there are three parts:\n",
    "$base 10 - 6.626 \\times 10^{-26}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* The sign, the exponent and what is called the significant. A float has the same three parts, but now they are only 0 or 1.\n",
    "$base 2 -.101101 \\times 2^{-101}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single Precision:\n",

    "### Overflow / Underflow Errors\n",
    "* The computer uses a finite number of bytes to represent a number. This means there is a biggest possible floating point number the computer can represent.\n",
    "* In python the is about $10^{308}$. If we tried to do ```y-10*1e308``` in Python, the value of y would be set to inf. This si called an overflow error.\n",
    "* There is also a smallest possible float on the computer. If you try to make a float smaller than this value it will be set to 0.0, and you will get an underflow error.\n",
    "* In most languages integers also have a maximum value, which is why there are many types of integer variables. Python simply allocates more memory to store an integer, until you run out of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy - Rounding Error\n",
    "* A finite number of bytes means that the value of floats can not be kept with infinite accuracy. the value of $\\pi$ has been determined to billions of digits of accuracy, but the computer will use a truncated value of $\\pi$ with as many digits as it uses to hold any float value.\n",
    "* Since the computer stores a number in binary, it won't even necessarily store the same value as you enter for a float.\n",
